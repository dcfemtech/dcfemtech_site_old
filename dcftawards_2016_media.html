<h2>DCFemTech Recognizes ‘Powerful Women Programmers and Designers’ During Second Annual Awards Program<h2>
<h2>Reception to celebrate award recipients scheduled for April 13th</h2>

<p>April 6, 2016 —Washington, DC — <a href="http://dcfemtech.github.io">DCFemTech</a>, the coalition of women leaders aimed at amplifying the efforts of women in tech organizations, has recognized 52 women as recipients of their ‘Powerful Women Programmers and Designers’ Award. On April 13th, the organization and its members will host a reception at Social Tables’ headquarters in D.C. to celebrate the recipients and nominees. The District’s CTO, Archana Vemulapalli, will address the audience ahead of the recognition ceremony.</p>
 
<p>DCFemTech opened the call for nominations for outstanding women programmers/engineers and designers based in the DC region on February 24, 2016 and received 190 submissions. The awards were expanded to include a design category for 2016 as a result of the overwhelming response in 2015.</p>
 
<p>Nominations were down selected by a committee made up of twelve women programmers, engineers, designers and executives for each category.</p>

<p>This year’s programmer recipients were chosen based on: Impact on organization (helped company/non-profit grow & achieve goals); Complexity of issues addressed with code (building a webpage vs. a complex system); Impact on community (contributed to broader tech/women in tech community or open source contributions).</p>

<p>The design recipients were selected based on similar criteria: Impact on organization (helped company/non-profit grow & achieve goals); Complexity of issues addressed with design (designing a platform that provides a great user experience vs. one page website); and Impact on community (contributed to broader tech/women in tech community or open source contributions).</p>
 
<p>We are pleased to announce that the award recipients are:</p>
